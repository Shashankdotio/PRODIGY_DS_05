## Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights

Welcome to the repository for my Prodigy InfoTech Internship! This repository details Task 5 of my internship, which emphasizes data cleaning, analysis, and uncovering valuable patterns.

### Task Overview:
- **1. Titanic Survival Detection**
Description: This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.

- **2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python**
Description: In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.

- **3. Iris Flower Classification**
Description: The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

- **4. Sales Prediction using Python**
Description: This project focuses on predicting sales for a business. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model to forecast future sales.

- **5. Credit Card Fraud Detection**
Description: In the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project addresses class imbalance, preprocesses data, and uses logistic regression for classification.

### Knowledge Acquired
Task 5 boosted my data analysis skills, refining techniques like cleaning and exploring data. It focused on uncovering patterns in traffic accident data, revealing links between road conditions, weather, and accidents. It also enhanced my ability to create clear visuals, aiding in communicating findings and recommendations for road safety measures.
